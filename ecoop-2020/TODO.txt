* evaluation
  abstract: "33 files out of 244 had no differences"
  But what about the rest?
  I would expect that our results are sometimes more specific than DT and other times do not cover all cases.
  Can the comparator be amended to better qualify the difference between the two declaration files?

* the comparator
  Such a tool should already exist as part of TSEvolve.
  How is our implementation different from what they use to compare?
